Final Year Project – Honor Project
Overview
Under Prof. W.C. Siu's (Emeritus Professor) supervision at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (2024-2025), we explored deep learning models to create high-resolution images and improve super-resolution models. Advanced models such as StyleGAN2 and Domain Transfer in Latent Space (DTLS) were used in the project to transform noise into high-quality images of face generation. 
Objectives
* Employ GAN and DDPM methods to generate high-quality images from random input noise.
* Improve super-resolution to process low-resolution images and produce results that look realistic.
* Use pre-trained StyleGAN2 models to generate Asian face datasets with transfer learning.
